Although the program is really cool, it is not that effective at catching social distance violations. There are many occasions in the video where people are closer than 6ft, but the program does not pick up on it.

If we are somehow able to measure distance then yes, but other than that not really, because there are many factors that goes into the transfer of the disease such as wearing a mask, gloves, etc.

I would try to improve the height of the video because in my video the camera could not catch people that were next to each other at a certain angle. I would also try to include a counter for how many times people are touched.
